# SceneCalculator

This is a simple calculator project with an additional feature of changing the background image
when the page first loads. So we give it a name of "SceneCalculator".


## Features

- Background image Change: Changing the background image when the page first loads. 

- Responsive Design: Responsive calculator that adjusts for common screen sizes.

- Number-wrapping:  Make long numbers wrap instead of floating horizontally.

- Arithmetic operations: Addition, subtraction, multiplication, division.

- Error preventing: Displaying "Error" for invalid calculations.

- Clear, Backspace, and Equals: Clear button (C) to reset the calculator.
                                Backspace key or button (X) to delete the last entered digit.
                                Equals key or Enter key or button (=) to display the result.

- Keyboard support: Allowing you to use the keyboard to input numbers and calculate.

- User-Friendly interface: Beautiful and easy-to-use interface.


### Prerequisites

- We used Sass (SCSS) for styling this project, and the styles are compiled into CSS using Gulp.
  If you plan to use Sass in your fork, you may want to consider using Gulp to compile it or using a Sass compiling extension. But, if you prefer to work with CSS directly, the compiled CSS file is available, and you won't need a Gulpfile for that.
